## Scalable Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This project creates a scalable tic tac toe game that can be a normal board of 3x3 and can scale up to 26x26. It also features the option to adjust how many consecutive values needed to win a game. By default a tic tac toe game would need 3 in a row, but if we have a board of 7x7 we can adjust is to 5 in a row or 7 in a row.

The purpose of the project was to create a fun programming project to help my cousin gain interest in programming and help him understand the basics of coding concepts such as variables, loops, and arrays.

Example of 3x3 board:
