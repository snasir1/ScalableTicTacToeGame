## Scalable Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This project implements a scalable tic-tac-toe game, allowing players to choose various board sizes ranging from 3x3 to 26x26. The game also provides the flexibility to adjust the number of consecutive values required to win a game. By default, tic-tac-toe requires three in a row to win, but on larger boards, such as 7x7, the winning condition can be adjusted to five or seven in a row.

The project was specifically created with the intention of helping my cousin learn fundamental programming concepts such as variables, loops, and multi-dimensional arrays. By providing an enjoyable game for players, the project serves as a learning opportunity that encourages the development of problem-solving skills and showcases the practical application of these concepts. In addition, it promotes customization, entertainment value, and fun recreation, enhancing the overall experience of both learning and playing the game.
